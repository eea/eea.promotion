====================
Promotion Admin View
====================

The promotion admin view gives an overview of the internal promotions available on the
site. We have a few promotions set up for us. They should be found by the admin view:

  >>> from eea.promotion.browser.admin import AdminView
  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()
  >>> admin = AdminView(self.portal, request)
  >>> promos = admin.find_promotions()
  >>> len(promos)
  3

  >>> p = promos[0]

This is the title of the promotions context object:

  >>> p['title']
  'Test Item 0'

A promotion can be placed in more than one location. This far only Front Page
and Themes are implemented:

  >>> p['locations']
  u'Front Page, Themes'

If the promotion is visible in the themes section, we might want to see which themes it's
visible in:

  >>> p['themes']
  u'agriculture, air'

The active flag signals if the promotion is at alive or dead, i.e. if it's actually shown
anywhere on the site.

  >>> p['active']
  True
