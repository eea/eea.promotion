#2562 Content can't be promoted if no frontpage section is selected
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This problem occured when a promotion was only marked as global and no frontpage
section was set. This resulted in that frontpage_section was None and crashed the
display_globally property.

  >>> from eea.promotion.interfaces import IPromotion, IPromotable
  >>> self.item.setImage(self.img)
  >>> foo = self.item.restrictedTraverse("@@createPromotion")()
  >>> promotion = IPromotion(self.item)
  >>> promotion.locations = [u'Global']
  >>> foo = promotion.display_globally
