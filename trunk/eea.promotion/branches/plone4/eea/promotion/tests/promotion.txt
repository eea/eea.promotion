Permissions
-----------

To add promotions to the site, you must have the 'Manage promotions'
permission. This is applied to the 'Manager' and 'PromotionManager' roles:

  >>> 'PromotionManager' in self.portal.validRoles()
  True
  >>> 'Manage promotions' in [i['name'] for i in
  ...      self.portal.permissionsOfRole('PromotionManager') if i['selected']]
  True
  >>> 'Manage promotions' in [i['name'] for i in
  ...      self.portal.permissionsOfRole('Manager') if i['selected']]
  True


Adding Promotions
-----------------

We have been given an ATNewsItem. If eea.promotion has been installed
correctly, this type should be marked as IPromotable.

  >>> item = self.item
  >>> from eea.promotion.interfaces import IPromotable
  >>> IPromotable.providedBy(item)
  True

Before we can make a promotion out of it, we have to upload an image

  >>> item.setImage(self.img)

Let's also make a swedish translation of the item. When the canonical is
promoted, this translation to be promoted as well:

  >>> from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName
  >>> lt = getToolByName(self.portal, 'portal_languages')
  >>> lt.manage_setLanguageSettings('en', ['en', 'sv', 'pl'])
  >>> item.addTranslation('sv')
  >>> item_sv = item.getTranslation('sv')
  >>> item_sv.reindexObject()

When making a promotion out of it, the createPromotion action sets the marker
interface and redirects us to the edit form:

  >>> edit_form_url = item.restrictedTraverse("@@createPromotion")()
  >>> from eea.promotion.interfaces import IPromoted
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item)
  True

The translations are promoted as well:

  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item_sv)
  True

Now we can edit its promotion settings:

  >>> from eea.promotion.interfaces import IPromotion
  >>> promotion = IPromotion(item)
  >>> promotion.locations = [u'Front Page', u'Themes']

The settings for the translated objects are the same:

  >>> IPromotion(item_sv).locations
  [u'Front Page', u'Themes']

If we make another translation afterwards, we can synchronize the promotion
settings with the syncPromotions action:

  >>> item.addTranslation('pl')
  >>> item_pl = item.getTranslation('pl')
  >>> item_pl.reindexObject()
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item_pl)
  False
  >>> _ = item.restrictedTraverse("@@promoteTranslations")()
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item_pl)
  True


Global Promotions
-----------------

A global promotion has the 'Global' location checked:

  >>> promotion.display_globally
  False

  >>> promotion.locations = [u'Global']
  >>> promotion.display_globally
  True

The 'globalPromotion' adapters finds the global promotion for us. It's in the
form of a list. This is so that it can be sent to the same macro that renders
the regular promtions:

  >>> item.reindexObject()
  >>> adapter = self.portal.restrictedTraverse('@@globalPromotion')
  >>> gpromo = adapter()[0]
  >>> gpromo['id'] == item.id
  True


Deactivation
------------

To deactivate a promotion, simply uncheck all locations. It will not show
anywhere:

  >>> promotion.active
  True
  >>> promotion.locations = []
  >>> promotion.active
  False


Removing Promotions
-------------------

To unmark the IPromoted interface and completely remove the promotion
settings, use the removePromotion action:

  >>> _ = item.restrictedTraverse("@@removePromotion")()
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item)
  False
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item_sv)
  False
  >>> IPromoted.providedBy(item_pl)
  False
